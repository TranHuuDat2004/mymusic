![MyMusic Player Screenshot](img/demo.jpg) <!-- THAY THẾ bằng ảnh chụp màn hình chính của giao diện -->

MyMusic Player is an online music player interface designed and developed to provide a simple, modern, and intuitive music listening experience, inspired by popular platforms like Spotify and Zing MP3.

## 🎯 Project Goals

The main goal of this project is to build a proof-of-concept demonstrating capabilities in developing user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) for web applications. The focus was on the following aspects:

*   🎨 **Interface Design:** Create an aesthetically pleasing, clean, and easy-to-navigate interface.
*   ▶️ **Core Functionality:** Implement basic music player functions, including play/pause, song progress display, and volume control.
*   🎵 **Content Organization:** Effectively present song lists and related information.
*   📱 **Responsive Design:** Ensure the interface displays and functions optimally across various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.
*   ✨ **Dynamic Interaction:** Utilize JavaScript to create dynamic interface elements and respond smoothly to user interactions.

This project also served as an excellent opportunity to practice and reinforce core front-end development skills.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

MyMusic Player is built entirely with fundamental front-end technologies:

*   **HTML5:** Provides the semantic structure for the web page content.
*   **CSS3:** Styles the interface, including modern layout techniques like Flexbox, Grid Layout, and using CSS Custom Properties for theme management (e.g., dark/light mode if implemented).
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** Handles all application logic, user interactions, player state management, and dynamic interface updates. This project was built **without relying on external JavaScript frameworks or libraries** to focus on core JS capabilities.
*   **Hosting:** Deployed as a static website via [GitHub Pages](https://tranhuudat2004.github.io/mymusic/).

##  scope Scope and Limitations

MyMusic Player is a **static web application** and operates entirely on the client-side (browser). Due to this, it has the following limitations:

*   **Static Data:** Song lists, artist information, and album art are currently hardcoded within the JavaScript source. They cannot be added, edited, or deleted by users through the interface.
*   **No Server-Side Features:**
    *   No database integration.
    *   No user login/registration functionality.
    *   No server-side personal playlist storage.
    *   No music file upload capability.
*   **Standalone Operation:** Listening status, playlists, or preferences are not synchronized across different devices or browser sessions.

These limitations are inherent to a static front-end project focused on demonstrating client-side UI/UX and interaction design.
